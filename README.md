> Examples of configuring `.babelrc` and `.languagebabel` files as used in the Github [Atom editor](https://atom.io/) together with the package [language-babel](https://github.com/gandm/language-babel)

### Install

  * Clone this project repo.
  * cd to this project.
  * `npm install` to get babel-core and other dependencies.
  * Run Atom and open as a project folder.
  * Ensure that files are handled by `language-babel` grammar.
  * Ensure the setting `Allow Local Override` in the package is on.

### Examples

  Just edit and save files and see what happens! The source directory names have meaning.
